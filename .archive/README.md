# The Archive

This is where we keep things that are not in use anymore for record keeping
purposes. Also, it's nicer to have them in the repo's main branch rather than
just deleting them away and kinda hiding them in the git history.

Maybe one day, they'd prove useful one way or another.

## Structure

Things kept in this folder has the structure as if `.archive` itself were the
root/home, i.e. the `~` folder.
